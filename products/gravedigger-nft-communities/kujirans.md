### About Kuijrans

Kujirans is a community-driven IBC NFT Project that offers participants the ability to invest in the project simply by minting and holding NFTs. It rewards holders at every level while still gifting half of its initial mint revenue and 100% of all ongoing royalties to all KUJI stakers.
