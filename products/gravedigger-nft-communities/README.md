# GraveDigger NFT Communities

### **Overview**

GraveDigger Collections offer a unique opportunity to leverage the passionate and expansive interchain community built by BackBone Labs and the various teams that have already launched GraveDigger collections across the Cosmos ecosystem.

### **Yield-Bearing by Default**

Each GraveDigger collection is inherently yield-bearing. Each GraveDigger collection is linked to a GraveDigger LST. GraveDigger collections earn yield-bearing bASSETs, maximizing capital efficiency. This setup ensures that NFT owners continuously benefit from the staking and liquidity provision associated with bASSETs.

### **Powered by Enterprise DAO**

GraveDigger collections are powered by Enterprise DAO, a cutting-edge DAO tooling protocol. This integration allows NFT owners to participate in DAO governance and benefit from a seamless reward distribution mechanism. The decentralized nature of Enterprise DAO ensures that all NFT holders have a voice and can participate in the decision-making process.

### **Fair and Equitable Airdrops**

Airdrops within the GraveDigger ecosystem are treated with fairness and equity. Regardless of the floor price, each NFT is valued equally. For instance, 1 NFT from one collection holds the same value as 1 NFT from any other collection when it comes to airdrops like $SOUL. This ensures a fair distribution of rewards across the entire GraveDigger NFT community, promoting inclusivity and equal opportunity for all participants.
