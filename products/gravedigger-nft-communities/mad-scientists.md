### About Mad Scientists

The Mad Scientist (MS) collection is a unique collection and a first-of-a-kind in more than one way. Following the SAIL Program proposal allowing BackBone Labs to launch NFTs on Osmosis, the Mad Scientists is the first collection ever to launch on the Osmosis blockchain with the help of the Rekt Gang who took the lead on developing the collection alongside BackBone Labs.\
As well as being the first to launch on Osmosis the Mad Scientist collection also used a highly experimental and highly successful way of launching by using a token called $LAB that had price discovery via a [StreamSwap](https://app.streamswap.io/stream/OSMO/8) event.

### What is $LAB?

LAB is a fair-launch token which is used to mint Mad Scientists.

### How is Mad Scientist Revenue generated?

Revenue for Mad Scientists is Generated from the GraveDigger. Stakers of 2 or more Mad Scientists receive a weekly distribution of bOSMO collected by the GraveDiggers performance fee.

### **FAQ**

#### **How many $LAB tokens does it take to mint a Mad Scientist NFT?** &#x20;

It takes exactly 10 $LAB tokens to mint 1 Mad Scientist NFT.  &#x20;

#### **What if I don’t get 10 $LAB tokens to mint an NFT, what can I do with a smaller share of $LAB?**&#x20;

You can hold the $LAB, buy more or sell the tokens in a liquidity pool (LP). The value of $LAB will be closely correlated with the value of Mad Scientists NFTs.  

#### **How to earn real yield?** &#x20;

You will be able to stake 2 Mad Scientists NFTs to earn real yield in $bOSMO from our Liquid Staking Derivatives Platform called The Gravedigger. Many additional perks are expected for NFT holders.&#x20;

#### **What will happen with the $LAB tokens used to mint Mad Scientists NFTs?**&#x20;

They will be removed from circulation.  

#### &#x20;**"This is complicated, why not do a regular mint?"** &#x20;

This allows for a fair launch to everyone, without using a time-consuming and usually unfair WL process or being at the mercy of bots during public mint.\
