# Counter Biding

### What is Counter Bidding?

Counter bidding on an NFT marketplace refers to the process where a potential buyer responds to an existing bid on an NFT with a higher offer. This mechanism is a fundamental aspect of auction-style sales commonly found on NFT platforms.

### Why is it important?

The counter-bidding process encourages competitive bidding, potentially increasing the final sale price of the NFT. This mechanism is vital in ensuring a fair market value for NFTs by allowing market demand to dictate pricing dynamically.

### How does it work?

1. **Initial Bid**: A user places a bid on an NFT listed for auction.
2. **Counter Bid**: Another user sees the initial bid and decides to place a higher bid to outbid the first user.
3. **Bid War**: This process can repeat, with multiple users placing progressively higher bids, driving up the price of the NFT.
4. **Auction End**: The auction ends either at a specified time or when a pre-determined condition is met (such as a "buy it now" price), and the highest bidder wins the NFT.

### Key Points of Counter Bidding:

* **Transparency**: All bids are usually visible to all participants, ensuring transparency.
* **Fair Market Value**: Encourages achieving a price that reflects true market demand.
* **Dynamic Pricing**: Prices are not fixed and can rise significantly due to competitive bids.
* **User Engagement**: Increases user interaction and engagement on the platform.

Counter bidding is similar to traditional auction systems used in art, collectibles, and other markets, adapted to the digital and decentralized nature of NFTs and blockchain technology.

### Positive Feedback Loops

The Counter Biding feature opens up positive feedback loops. The use of bASSETs in the Counter Biding mechanism feeds the GraveDigger by increasing the amount deposited. This in turn has positive effects on $SOUL staking reward and NFT staking rewards for the [GraveDigger Collections](../gravedigger-nft-communities/) as more fees are collected and redistributed back to the community.\
