# Counter Offers

### What are Counter Offers?

Counter offers on an NFT marketplace refer to the negotiation process where a potential buyer responds to a seller's asking price or an existing offer with a different price. Unlike counter bidding, which involves outbidding in an auction-style setting, counter offers facilitate a more direct negotiation between buyer and seller to reach a mutually agreeable price.

### Why is it important?

The counter offer process allows for flexibility in pricing and negotiation, enabling both buyers and sellers to arrive at a fair market value through direct interaction. This mechanism fosters a dynamic marketplace where the final sale price is determined through negotiation rather than a static price or competitive bidding.

### How does it work?

1. **NFT Listing**: NFT is listed for sale on Necropolis.
2. **Initial Offer**: A user makes an offer on an NFT listed for sale.
3. **Counter Offer**: The seller reviews the offer and, if not satisfied, responds with a different price.
4. **Negotiation**: This process can repeat, with the buyer and seller exchanging offers until both parties agree on a price.
5. **Agreement**: Once a mutual agreement is reached, the transaction is completed at the agreed-upon price.

### Key Points of Counter Offers:

* **Flexibility**: Allows for direct negotiation, providing flexibility in reaching a deal.
* **Fair Market Value**: Encourages a pricing strategy that reflects true market demand through negotiation.
* **Dynamic Pricing**: Prices can adjust based on the negotiation process, rather than fixed or progressively higher bids.
* **User Engagement**: Promotes active participation and interaction between buyers and sellers on the platform leading to greater market efficiency

Counter offers are similar to traditional negotiation systems used in various markets, such as real estate and retail, adapted to the digital and decentralized nature of NFTs and blockchain technology.

### Positive Feedback Loops

The counter offer feature can create positive feedback loops within the marketplace. When users engage in counter offers, the dynamic pricing and negotiation process can lead to increased transactions and market activity and overall market efficiency. This, in turn, benefits the overall ecosystem by enhancing liquidity and ensuring that prices reflect genuine market demand. Additionally, the use of marketplace-specific tokens or assets in the counter offer mechanism can contribute to the growth and sustainability of the platform by increasing transaction volumes and community engagement.
